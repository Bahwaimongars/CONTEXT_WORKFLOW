# CONTEXT WORKFLOW - AI-Powered Development Framework

A comprehensive workflow system that transforms Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into actionable implementation plans using AI assistance.

## 🎯 What is Context Workflow?

Context Workflow is a structured approach to software development that:

- **Transforms ideas into action** - Convert PRDs into detailed implementation plans
- **Ensures consistency** - Maintain project standards across all development phases
- **Accelerates development** - Leverage AI to generate comprehensive technical documentation
- **Prevents common issues** - Built-in best practices and error tracking

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Define Your Project

**Fill out the PRD.md file**

- Describe your project vision and objectives
- List core features and requirements
- Define success metrics and constraints
- Use the provided template and examples

### Step 2: Customize Your Standards

**Review and adapt these files to your project needs:**

📁 **Project_structure.md**

- Modify folder organization patterns
- Adapt to your tech stack (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Update file naming conventions

🎨 **UI_UX_doc.md**

- Customize color palettes and design tokens
- Add your brand guidelines
- Modify component patterns for your design system

🐛 **bugs_tracking.md** _(optional)_

- Adapt bug reporting templates
- Customize priority levels and categories
- Add project-specific debugging tools

### Step 3: Configure AI Rules

**Check and adapt the workflow rules:**

- Review `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc`
- Update if you changed project structure
- Ensure rules match your development preferences

### Step 4: Generate Implementation Plan

**Use your AI model to create the implementation roadmap:**

```
Prompt: "Generate the Implementation.md file using the generate.mdc rules"
```

The AI will analyze your PRD and create:

- ✅ Feature breakdown and prioritization
- 🛠️ Technology stack recommendations
- 📋 Stage-by-stage implementation plan
- 🎯 Success metrics and testing guidelines

### Step 5: Start Development

**Begin coding with your AI assistant:**

```
Prompt: "Let's start with Stage 1 of the implementation plan"
```

## 📋 Alternative: Lite Version

For beginners or simpler projects, use the lite version:

1. Rename `generate-lite-version.mdc` to `generate.mdc`
2. This version provides:
   - Simplified instructions
   - More guidance for beginners
   - Streamlined decision-making process

## 🤖 AI Integration Tips

### Best Prompts for Generation

```
✅ Good: "Generate Implementation.md using the PRD and project structure guidelines"
❌ Avoid: "Make me a plan"

✅ Good: "Start Stage 1 implementation focusing on authentication setup"
❌ Avoid: "Code something"
```
