# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - How to Fill This File

## What is a PRD?

A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is the foundation of any successful project. It defines **what** you're building, **why** you're building it, and **how** it should work. Think of it as your project's blueprint.

## How to Fill This PRD - Best Practices

### 1. **Project Description** üìù

**What to include:**

- Clear, concise project name
- One-sentence elevator pitch
- Problem you're solving
- Target audience

**Best Practice:** Keep it simple and jargon-free. Anyone should understand what your project does in 30 seconds.

### 2. **Objective** üéØ

**What to include:**

- Primary goal of the project
- Success metrics (how you'll measure success)
- Timeline expectations

**Best Practice:** Use SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

### 3. **Core Features** ‚ö°

**What to include:**

- Must-have features (MVP)
- Nice-to-have features (future releases)
- Features you explicitly won't include

**Best Practice:** Prioritize ruthlessly. Focus on the 3-5 features that deliver 80% of the value.

### 4. **User Stories** üë•

**What to include:**

- "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"
- Different user personas and their needs
- User journey/workflow

**Best Practice:** Write from the user's perspective, not from a technical standpoint.

### 5. **Technical Requirements** üîß

**What to include:**

- Technology stack preferences
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations
- Integration needs

**Best Practice:** Focus on requirements, not implementation details. Leave room for technical creativity.

### 6. **Design & User Experience** üé®

**What to include:**

- Visual style preferences
- User interface requirements
- Accessibility needs
- Mobile/responsive requirements

**Best Practice:** Include mockups or wireframes if available. Describe the feeling you want users to have.

## Tips for Success üí°

1. **Start Simple:** Focus on the core problem first
2. **Be Specific:** Vague requirements lead to confused development
3. **Think User-First:** Always consider the user's perspective
4. **Stay Flexible:** PRDs can evolve as you learn more
5. **Get Feedback:** Share your PRD with stakeholders before development starts

Remember: A good PRD is clear, concise, and actionable. It should answer the "what" and "why" while leaving room for creative "how" solutions.
